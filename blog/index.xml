The discovery overhead issue becomes extremely severe when running over wireless technologies, such as WiFi, and in particular in combination with more complex robots, robot swarms and tele-operation. The ROS2 Discovery Service has been proposed as a way to alleviate the problem, not necessarily to solve it.
In the reminder of this post I&amp;rsquo;ll explain the essence of problem, remind what was tried in the past and unveils a Zenoh based solution that (1) drastically reduces DDS discovery overhead &amp;ndash; from 97% to 99,9% in tested scenarios, (2) allows for peer-to-peer communication when useful, (3) enables efficient Internet-scale routing when necessary, and (3) does not require any changes to your existing ROS2 systems.</description></item><item><title>Zenoh Aithusa Hatched Out!</title><link>/blog/2020-10-08-aithusa/</link><pubDate>Thu, 08 Oct 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/blog/2020-10-08-aithusa/</guid><description>We have been waiting this very moment for several months. Months of patient dedication, months of hard and creative work. Months in which each and every member of the zenoh team has made his and her best to give our little dragon all it needed to succed in the complicated world of Internet Scale Protocols.
Today, at about 11.00 Paris Time Zenoh Aithusa Hatched Out!
Aithusa is the code-name for the first release of our Rust-based zenoh infrastructure, A supercharged of new features and improvements, including better performance, improved network scheduling, ROS2 integration, and DDS Plugin.</description></item><item><title>Zenoh Tidings</title><link>/blog/2020-06-29-zenoh-tidings/</link><pubDate>Tue, 30 Jun 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/blog/2020-06-29-zenoh-tidings/</guid><description>In our last blog we had announced a rewrite of zenoh in Rust. The wrote the first version of zenoh in OCaml, a super-neat ML-derived functional programming language. OCaml allowed us to experiment very quickly and have good performances. Yet, one of the major feedback we were receiving from the community was that few people knew this programming language and this was limiting contributions. Beside, we had the desire to make zenoh even faster and smaller.</description></item><item><title>A Year Full of Zenoh</title><link>/blog/2020-01-01-zenohtude/</link><pubDate>Wed, 01 Jan 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/blog/2020-01-01-zenohtude/</guid><description>First of all we would like to take a moment to wish all of you a 2020 filled with joy, health, peace and success.
This year marks a very important landmark for us. After having kicked-off the Eclipse Edge Native working group, last December, we are bringing zenoh to Eclipse and are starting to work a Rust rewrite of the zenoh router. As part for the rewrite we have just about to complete a review of the zenoh protocol and will be updating the specification accordingly in the weeks to come.</description></item></channel></rss>
