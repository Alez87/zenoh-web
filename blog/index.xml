Months of patient dedication, months of hard and creative work. Months in which each and every member of the zenoh team has made his and her best to give our little dragon all it needed to succed in the complicated world of Internet Scale Protocols.
Today, at about 11.00 Paris Time Zenoh Aithusa Hatched Out!
Aithusa is the code-name for the first release of our Rust-based zenoh infrastructure, A supercharged of new features and improvements, including better performance, improved network scheduling, ROS2 integration, and DDS Plugin.</description></item><item><title>Zenoh Tidings</title><link>/blog/2020-06-29-zenoh-tidings/</link><pubDate>Tue, 30 Jun 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/blog/2020-06-29-zenoh-tidings/</guid><description>In our last blog we had announced a rewrite of zenoh in Rust. The wrote the first version of zenoh in OCaml, a super-neat ML-derived functional programming language. OCaml allowed us to experiment very quickly and have good performances. Yet, one of the major feedback we were receiving from the community was that few people knew this programming language and this was limiting contributions. Beside, we had the desire to make zenoh even faster and smaller.</description></item><item><title>A Year Full of Zenoh</title><link>/blog/2020-01-01-zenohtude/</link><pubDate>Wed, 01 Jan 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/blog/2020-01-01-zenohtude/</guid><description>First of all we would like to take a moment to wish all of you a 2020 filled with joy, health, peace and success.
This year marks a very important landmark for us. After having kicked-off the Eclipse Edge Native working group, last December, we are bringing zenoh to Eclipse and are starting to work a Rust rewrite of the zenoh router. As part for the rewrite we have just about to complete a review of the zenoh protocol and will be updating the specification accordingly in the weeks to come.</description></item></channel></rss>
