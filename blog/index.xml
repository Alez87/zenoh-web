This year marks a very important landmark for us. After having kicked-off the Eclipse Edge Native working group, last December, we are bringing zenoh to Eclipse and are starting to work a Rust rewrite of the zenoh router. As part for the rewrite we have just about to complete a review of the zenoh protocol and will be updating the specification accordingly in the weeks to come.</description></item></channel></rss>
