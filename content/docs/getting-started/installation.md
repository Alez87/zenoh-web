To get up and running with <b>zenoh</b> you will have to install the infrastructure and then get hold of the API you would like to use to write your applications. 

# Installing zenoh's Infrastructure
At the present stage zenoh's infrastructure is supported only on Linux and MacOS. Below are the detailed information on how to install on supported platforms.

## MacOS
The first step is to tap our brew package repository:

```bash
$ brew tap eclipse-zenoh/homebrew-zenoh
```    

Then simply install zenoh as follows:

```bash
$ brew install zenoh
```

## Linux
The Linux installation procedure depends on the package manager supported by your distribution. Below are detailed information for <b>apt</b> and <b>yum</b> based distros.

### Debian and Friends
As a first step add our package repository to your package manager configuration by running the following command:

```bash
$ echo "deb [trusted=yes] http://pkgs.adlink-labs.tech/debian ./" | sudo tee -a /etc/apt/sources.list > /dev/null
```

Then update the packages list by:

```bash
$ sudo apt update
```

Now you can install zenoh:

```bash
$ sudo apt install zenoh
```

### RedHat and Friends
The first step is to add the ATOLab repository to <b>yum</b>, this can be done by editing the file:

```bash
$ sudo vi /etc/yum.repos.d/atolab.repo
```

and writing the following content:

```toml,ignore
[atolab-repo]
name=Atolab RPM Package Repo
baseurl=http://pkgs.adlink-labs.tech/centos/     # server-name or repo-server-ip
enabled=1
gpgcheck=0
```

At this point update the packages and install as follows:

```bash
$ yum repolist
$ yum update
$ yum install zenoh
```

# Testing Your Installation
To test the installation, try to see the zenoh man page by executing the following command:

```bash
$ zenohd --help
```
You should see the following output on your console:

```text
