At the present time there is an undergoing standardisation effort to standardise a protocol for e__X__tremely __R__esource __C__onstrained __E__nvironments (XRCE). Beside staring the standardisation process we have submitted a proposal that is quite different from competings into two respects. First it supports peer-to-peer  as well as brokered communication. Second it is a few times more efficient in time and space than competing submissions.

While technically __zenoh__ implements our __XRCE__ proposal, considered that the standard has not been adopted yet we prefer to refer to the protocol using its code name -- zenoh.
